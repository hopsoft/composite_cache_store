## Why a composite cache?

Layered caching allows you to stack multiple caches... with different scopes, lifetimes, and levels of reliability.
This is a strategy that can yield several benefits.

- __Improved performance__
- __Higher throughput__
- __Reduced load__
- __Enhanced capacity/scalability__

Inner layer(s) are closer to the app's executing code, _typically in-memory within the same process_.
They provide the fastest reads and the shortest entry lifetime.
Outer layers are further away from the app's executing code,
_typically a third-party service (Redis, Memcached, etc.) running on separate machine(s)._
Outer layers are also more likely to be shared across processes, dynos, and servers.

You can configure each layer with different expiration times, eviction policies, and storage mechanisms...
This puts you in control of balancing the trade-offs between performance and data freshness.

__Inner layers are supersonic while outer layers are speedy.__

A cache hit on a local in-memory store compared to a cache hit on a remote out-of-memory store
is the equivalent of making a quick grocery run in a
[Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+](https://www.bugatti.com/models/chiron-models/chiron-super-sport-300/)
versus making the same trip on a bicyle...
_but all cache layers should be much faster than the underlying operations being optimized._

### Eventually Consistent

Layered caching techniques exhibit some of the same traits as distributed systems
because inner layers may hold onto __stale data__ until their entries expire.
__Be sure to configure inner layers with shorter lifetimes__.

Note that this behavior is also similar to the
[`race_condition_ttl`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Cache/Store.html#method-i-fetch-label-Options)
option in `ActiveSupport::Cache::Store` which helps avoid race conditions whenever multiple threads/processes attempt to write to the same cache entry simultaneously.

#### Gotchas

- __Data consistency__ - it's possible to end up with inconsistent or stale data
- __Over-caching__ - caching too much can lead to increased memory usage and even slower performance
- __Bugs/Testing__ - difficult bugs can be introduced with sophisticated caching techniques

## Dependencies

- [ActiveSupport `>= 6.0`](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/activesupport)

## Installation

```sh
bundle add "composite_cache_store"
```

## Setup

### Ruby on Rails

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
module Example
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, { url: "redis://example.com:6379/1" }
  end
end
```

```ruby
# config/initializers/composite_cache_store.rb
def Rails.composite_cache
  @composite_cache ||= CompositeCacheStore.new(
    # Layer 1 cache (inner) - employs an LRU eviction policy
    ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new(
      expires_in: 15.minutes, # constrain entry lifetime so the local cache doesn't drift out of sync
      size: 32.megabytes # constrain max memory used by the local cache
    ),

    # Layer 2 cache (outer)
    Rails.cache, # use whatever makes sense for your app

    # additional layers are optional
  )
end
```

## Usage

A composite cache is ideal for mitigating hot spot latency in frequently invoked areas of the codebase.

```ruby
# method that's invoked frequently by multiple processes
def hotspot
  # NOTE: expiration options are only applied to the outermost cache
  #       inner caches use their globally configured expiration policy
  Rails.composite_cache.fetch("example/slow/operation", expires_in: 12.hours) do
    # a slow operation
  end
end
```

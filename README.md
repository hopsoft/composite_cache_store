## Why a composite cache?

Layered caching allows you to stack multiple caches... with different scopes, lifetimes, and levels of reliability.
This is a strategy that can yield several benefits.

- __Improved performance__
- __Higher throughput__
- __Reduced load__
- __Enhanced capacity/scalability__

Inner cache layer(s) should be closer to the app's executing code, _typically in-memory within the same process_.
They provide the fastest reads and the shortest entry lifetime.
Outer layers will often be further away from the app's executing code,
_typically a third-party service (Redis, Memcached, etc.) running on separate machine(s)._
Outer layers are also typically shared by multiple processes, dynos, and servers.

You can configure each layer with different expiration times, eviction policies, and storage mechanisms...
This puts you in control of balancing the trade-offs between performance and data freshness.

__Inner layers are supersonic while outer layers are speedy.__

A cache hit on a local in-memory store compared to a cache hit on a remote out-of-memory store
is the equivalent of making a quick grocery run in a
[Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+](https://www.bugatti.com/models/chiron-models/chiron-super-sport-300/)
versus making the same trip on a bicyle...
_but all cache layers should be much faster than the underlying operations being optimized._

## Eventual consistentency

Layered caching techniques exhibit some of the same traits as [distributed systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency)
because inner layers may hold onto __stale data__ until their entries expire.
__Be sure to configure inner layers appropriately with shorter lifetimes__.

Note that this behavior is also similar to the
[`race_condition_ttl`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Cache/Store.html#method-i-fetch-label-Options)
option in `ActiveSupport::Cache::Store` which helps avoid race conditions whenever multiple threads/processes attempt to write to the same cache entry simultaneously.

__Be mindful of the potential gotchas.__

- __Data consistency__ - it's possible to end up with inconsistent or stale data
- __Over-caching__ - caching too much can lead to increased memory usage and even slower performance
- __Bugs/Testing__ - difficult bugs can be introduced with sophisticated caching techniques

## Dependencies

- [ActiveSupport `>= 6.0`](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/activesupport)

## Installation

```sh
bundle add "composite_cache_store"
```

## Setup

Here's an example of how you might set up layered caching in a Rails application.

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
module Example
  class Application < Rails::Application
    config.cache_store = :redis_cache_store, { url: "redis://example.com:6379/1" }
  end
end
```

```ruby
# config/initializers/composite_cache_store.rb
def Rails.composite_cache
  @composite_cache ||= CompositeCacheStore.new(
    layers: [
      # Layer 1 cache (inner) - employs an LRU eviction policy
      ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new(
        expires_in: 15.minutes, # constrain entry lifetime so the local cache doesn't drift out of sync
        size: 32.megabytes # constrain max memory used by the local cache
      ),

      # Layer 2 cache (outer)
      Rails.cache, # use whatever makes sense for your app

      # additional layers are optional
    ]
  )
end
```

## Usage

A composite cache is ideal for mitigating hot spot latency in frequently invoked areas of the codebase.

```ruby
# method that's invoked frequently by multiple processes/machines
def hotspot
  # NOTE: expiration options are only applied to the outer-most layer
  #       inner layers will use their globally configured expiration policy
  #       unless the per-entry exiration is less than the layer's global policy
  Rails.composite_cache.fetch("example", expires_in: 12.hours) do
    # computationally expensive operation with high latency...
  end
end
```
